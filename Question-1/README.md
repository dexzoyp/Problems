# Question-1
Write a program that allocate buffer and store word of "characters", the size of the buffer is 1024 bytes. Suppose the container(vector,queue...) with words is given, each time at random position[0;1023] to check if there is enough space for the word to allocate it in the buffer, if the space is not enough, push the word in leftovers container. Every time allocated in the buffer is successful, print the message "Word is allocated!". At the end of allocation print the leftovers: "Not allocated words: word1,word2...". The program stops when it allocate maximum words in the buffer.
